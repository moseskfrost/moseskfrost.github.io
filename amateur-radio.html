                    <p>This handbook is useful for quickly referencing radio-related material.&nbsp; It covers the character set of International Morse Code, procedural signals, the R-S-T system, acronyms and abbreviations, Q-codes, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, modern and archaic.&nbsp; Available for download in Portable Document Format.</p>

                <p>44, dear reader!&nbsp; I am Moses K. Frost, <tt>SMØ-863Ø</tt>.</p>
                <p>&emsp;My interest in this activity lies in Morse Code, which I have been mastering since MMXVII.&nbsp; I initially found S. Morse's code system thanks to my tendency to find interesting languages to learn.&nbsp; (Of course, I had heard of <i>Morse Code</i> previously, but it never caught my mind until then.)&nbsp; I thought the concept of communicating with only on and off signals was really fascinating.&nbsp; After three days of studying, I had already learned most of the character set.</p>
                <p>&emsp;One day, I found &lt;morsecode.me&gt;.&nbsp; That was the first time I had put my knowledge to use, and communicated with other people in code on my spacebar&mdash;simulating a key.&nbsp; After a few years, I found their Reddit forum, reached out to B. Kanber&mdash;the developer of the website&mdash;and told him how much I appreciated his project.&nbsp; About a year after that, he had established a Discord server.&nbsp; I recall seeing a link to it on the website, when I joined the community, <i>presto.</i></p>
                <p>&emsp;There, I met Jason, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/K6JSC" target="_blank">K6JSC</a>.&nbsp; Not only did he shortly become a great friend of mine, but likewise an Elmer,¹ who has taught me a lot about Amateur Radio.&nbsp; He has greatly helped me throughout my journey, and I would not have made it here without him.&nbsp; <i>Give him the gold ingot, please.</i></p>
                <p>&emsp;Jason introduced me to <i>V-Band&thinsp;:</i> a fantastic on-line Morse chat room.&nbsp; <a href="https://hamradio.solutions/vband" target="_blank">Try it out for Yourself here!</a>²&nbsp; That day, we established my first simulated experience of Amateur Radio, with a QSO³ that lasted four hours&thinsp; <i>from two to six of the clock!</i>&nbsp; I have since made many more contacts on there, and it has truly supported me in developing my skills.&nbsp; A great thanks to David and Byon, who are the developers of this neat tool.&nbsp; Their platform, Ham Radio Solutions, also has a Discord server, through which I met Erik, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/K5EDH" target="_blank">K5EDH</a>.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Jason introduced me also to Vail&thinsp;: a cool alternative to V-Band.&nbsp; <a href="https://vail.woozle.org" target="_blank">Try it out for Yourself here!</a>²&nbsp; I have had much fun there, and I can highly recommend it to the proficient Brass Pounders out there.&nbsp; Vail, too, has a Discord server, and should You experience any difficulties with either site, I advise You join the communities and start troubleshooting&mdash;or just to chat!</p>

                <p>For the Christmas of MMXXI, I wanted an iambic <i>Paddle.</i>&nbsp; I did my research, and found Kari, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SMØHRP" target="_blank">SMØHRP</a>&thinsp;: the sole proprietor of <a href="https://dxsupply.com" target="_blank">DX Supply</a>.&nbsp; I arranged with him an order for my <i>Vibrocube Standard Upgraded.</i>&nbsp; At that time, I was trying to seek an Amateur Radio club, so while on the phone line with him, I took the opportunity to inquire if he knew of any&thinsp;; indeed did he&thinsp;!&nbsp; He suggested <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SK0QO" target="_blank">SKØQO</a>, and forwarded me to Lasse, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM0FDO" target="_blank">SMØFDO</a>.</p>
                <p>&emsp;After the line was cut, I dialed the number to which he referred me.&nbsp; I introduced myself and stated my intentions, after which we spoke for a long while.&nbsp; We arranged a meeting on the eighteenth of December&thinsp;: a Youngsters on the Air event, that was to be hosted at the QTH⁴ of the club.&nbsp; There, I met Lasse for the first time&mdash;without whom I would not be here, either&mdash;along with Kalle, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM0NUE" target="_blank">SMØNUE</a>, and Robban, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM0TAE" target="_blank">SMØTAE</a>.</p>
                <p>&emsp;I want to shout out the following persons, as well, which I met later on&thinsp;:&nbsp; Micke (<a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM0LYC" target="_blank">SMØLYC</a>), Uffe (<a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM0DWK" target="_blank">SMØDWK</a>), Hans (<a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM5JDL" target="_blank">SM5JDL</a>, from whom I got my radio), and Linus (<a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SM5OUU" target="_blank">SM5OUU</a>).</p>
                <p style="text-align:center; color:#00000080">• • •</p>
                <p>On the eighteenth of June, MMXXII, I was introduced to Larry, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/K7HN" target="_blank">K7HN</a>, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HamRadioLiveShow" target="_blank">the YouTube channel of Ham Radio Live</a>.&nbsp; He is live mostly every day, with updates on the latest Amateur Radio news.&nbsp; I greatly recommend You check him out, and become a part of the show Yourself!</p>

                    <h2>Keys</h2>
                    <p>I have one handpump from the Swedish Navy, that I got from <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/SK0QO" target="_blank">SKØQO</a>.&nbsp; I have increased its tension by adding an additional spring, and adjusted a larger gap&thinsp;; more tactile feedback, which I find satisfying&mdash;all of which <i>do</i> make the Vibrocube more comfortable for rag chewing.&nbsp; I have made a few modifications to this key, including a connection re-rout to two contact posts, and a mirror-finish polish.</p>
			        <p>&emsp;At the HamFest in Eskilstuna, on the fifteenth of April, MMXXIII, I got another Swedish Navy handpump in a different model.&nbsp; It looks older than the first, albeit I unfortunately lack access to documentation.&nbsp; (A picture will be uploaded here soon.)</p>
			        <p>&emsp;On the aforementioned on-line chat rooms, however, I mostly operate my Vibrocube&mdash;<i>that thing weighs three kilograms&thinsp;!</i>&nbsp; Essentially why I bought it in the first place.&nbsp; It is very nice to use, as there are jeweled movements in the fulcra of each paddle.&nbsp; I can send comfortably at thirty-five words per minute, when connected to my Daiwa DK-210.</p>

                    <p>I believe this deserves a separate segment.&nbsp; I mainly operate MacElroy's <i>Hole-in-the-Wall,</i> which I am borrowing from Lasse.&nbsp; I practice operating this Bug every day, on just my radio's sidetone, or in V-Band and Vail&thinsp;; many think I have become quite efficient with it.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;Buck, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/AA4SN" target="_blank">AA4SN</a>, is a skilled manufacturer of his very own Bugs, a <i>Home-Brewed Vertical Bug</i> of which he and his club were so kind to gift me!&nbsp; I am truly grateful, and should You read this, Buck <i>& company,</i> I want to heartfeltly thank You.</p></div>
