                    <h2>Harpsichord</h2>
			        <p>I was just browsing historic instruments, when I spotted a double-manual cembalo on sale.&nbsp; I messaged the seller, only to come practice for a few hours, to which she agreed.&nbsp; Frida Hyvönen was moving out of her studio, and had to get rid of the cembalo quickly, so she decided to ask if I wanted it.&nbsp; Of course, I accepted the offer, and on Friday, the second, I visited her studio to test the instrument, and O, was I satisfied.</p>
			        <p>&emsp;So, the moving process began, of transporting the cemalo to my Father's studio in Sickla&thinsp;; it was finally mounted on the ninth.&nbsp; I started studying this instrument more, the harpsichord history, and how to play them.&nbsp; Upon research, I discovered pipe organs function similarly, albeit of course more advanced, when I started looking into that.</p>

                <h2>Hässelby Missionskyrka</h2>
                <p>A friend of mine, whose father is the organist of their local Parish, invited me to play with him.&nbsp; On the twenty-first, I was picked up at seven, and played the organ for the very first time.&nbsp; It was a small choir organ, with only six stops on one manual and pedal, but a big milestone.</p>

                <h2>Hedvig Eleonora Kyrka</h2>
                <p>I started searching Churches, and visited several each week.&nbsp; On the tenth, I found Ulf Norberg in Hedvig Eleonora Kyrka, and spoke to him after an «after-week concert» he had just performed.&nbsp; We entered the organ tribune, and played together for a while.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEa_QvS5WK0" target="_blank">Watch his film on that organ here.</a>&nbsp; He gave me tips, and a booklet with W. A. Mozart scores to practice.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Around that time, I had also studied historic temperaments, and their enharmonic keyboards.&nbsp; I asked if he knew of such an organ within the area, to which he suggested I check out the German Church of Stockholm.</p>

                <h2>Deutsche Kirche von Stockholm</h2>
                <p>On the twelfth, I entered the Church that M:r Norberg had mentioned, without knowing it.&nbsp; The receptionist and I started talking, and she welcomed me warmly when I revealed I was an aspiring organist, then proceeded to tell me about the organs, when I realized where I was.&nbsp; I had to see it for myself, so she referred me to their Church musician, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhTnQFEl6A" target="_blank">Michael Dierks</a>.</p>
                <p>&emsp;I messaged him, and arranged to practice the <i>Düben-Orgel</i> on Wednesday, the twenty-second.&nbsp; I could not believe the reality, that I was sitting by this massive, gorgeous Baroque organ, which I was about to play for an hour, all by myself.&nbsp; This very accurate replica, constructed in MMIV, features quarter-comma meantone (A = 467 c. p. s.), ergo subsemitones for every D♯ / E♭; a short broken octave on all three manuals, and the Arp Schnitger kind on the pedal; all on a complete tracker action.&nbsp; I was supposed to try the <i>Juno-Orgel,</i> too, but I had no time for else than my dear Düben-Orgel.
                <p>&emsp;This would later become home every Sunday, between eleven and three&#8212;until half past four for all of summer.&nbsp; To this day, I attend every <i>Gotteſdienſt</i> without barely knowing any German, to hear M:r Dierks play my favorite instrument, and socialize with truly the best staff in the Church.</p>

                <h2>Sankta Maria Magdalena Kyrka</h2>
                <p>On the eighteenth, after a wait worth the while, I was finally let up to play the French Baroque organ in Sankta Maria Magdalena Kyrka.&nbsp; The keys are surprisingly stiff for being French, yet actually nice to play; the coupling mechanisms are hence extremely stiff.&nbsp; I sat there for an hour, for which I thank David Kronström&#8212;and my Mother, who I had record some pieces.</p>

                <h2>Fresta Kyrka</h2>
                <p>The twenty-sixth, I attended a concert in Fresta Kyrka, where there is a historic positive organ from MDCXCVII.&nbsp; After the concert was done, I asked the organist, Karin Krigsman Järnskoog, for permission to play it, which she kindly allowed.&nbsp; It features only six stops on one manual, without even a pull-down pedal, though still a delight to play.&nbsp; The condition is well-kept, and the pipes sing beautifully; the key touch is very shallow, which I really appreciate.</p>

                <h2>Sollentuna Kyrka</h2>
                <p>After a concert in Sankt Jakobs Kyrka, I spoke with the performer, Ania Proskourina.&nbsp; She was active in the building process of currently the only Metzler organ in Sweden, in Sollentuna Kyrka, where she is organist.&nbsp; She suggested I come to try it on the twelfth, to which I gladly agreed.&nbsp; The team knew what they were doing, building the perfect organ of superb quality, not unlike every Metzler organ.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeEpIcpGElQ&list=PL8NtfhNqRW1Vpd4HonF0cC1DBD-Z1WXAu" target="_blank">Hear Proskourina's recordings on it here.</a></p>

                <h2>Högalidskyrkan</h2>
                <p>The tenth, Högalidskyrkan was finally reinaugurated after renovation.&nbsp; Only a couple of days after, on Monday, I was guided through the Church, which I had never been to before.&nbsp; I was pleasured to meet Nils Larsson again&#8212;who I actually played with already on the twenty-fourth of February&#8212;and not long thereafter, I was honored the Baroque choir organ and whole nave to myself.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The twelfth of the following month, I played for five hours straight, acquainting myself with the instrument, before I gained great flow on the manuals and pedal.&nbsp; I like the mechanical noises of tracker consoles, which are surprisingly barely heard on this one, although its light keys make up for that.&nbsp; It features a nice <i>Cymbelſtjärna</i> to go along with celebratory tunes, which is not too common nowadays.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEa_QvS5WK0" target="_blank">See Larsson's video on it here.</a></p>
                <p>&emsp;I went there again the following day to play, albeit this instance lasted for only one hour, after I was complimented a bunch by the people that had visited the day before.&nbsp; Thank You, Nils Larsson and Maria Bergström, for making this possible!</p>
